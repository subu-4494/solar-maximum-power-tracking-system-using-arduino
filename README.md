# Servo Motor Control Using LDRs

This project controls the position of a servo motor based on the light intensity detected by two LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensors. It automatically adjusts the servo to track the brighter light source.

##  Theory of this Project

The project is based on the principle of a light-following mechanism:
- Two LDRs are placed such that they sense light from different directions.
- The difference in light intensity from the two LDRs is measured.
- Depending on which side is brighter, the servo motor rotates to align with the light.

##  How the Code Works

- The Arduino continuously reads analog values from the east and west LDRs.
- If the difference between them exceeds a threshold, the servo motor rotates towards the brighter side.
- The servo stops when the difference falls below the threshold.

## Conclusion

The Solar Maximum Power Tracking System effectively demonstrated how solar energy efficiency can be enhanced using a simple Arduino-based sun-tracking mechanism. By automatically adjusting the panel's orientation based on real-time light intensity from LDR sensors, the system ensures maximum exposure to sunlight throughout the day. This project highlights the potential of embedded systems and renewable energy integration, offering a scalable solution for energy optimization in both small-scale and commercial solar applications.
